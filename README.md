# Project Pilgrim (Prototype)

## About the project

This is a 2D game prototype inspired by **Hollow Knight / Silksong**, with a dark, gothic and melancholic theme.
The project is being developed as a hobby using **Godot Engine**.

> ⚠️ Currently, the project uses **placeholder sprites** while waiting for the final artwork.

## Current Features

- Player with basic movement (walk, jump, run)
- Simple attack system with hitbox
- Basic enemies with collision and damage
- Player states: idle, walk, jump, attack
- Health system and respawn / checkpoints
- Functional main scene and main menu
- Organized folder structure and modular scripts for future expansions

---

## Folder Structure

res://
`assets/` - Sprites, sounds and temporary images
`scenes/` - All game scenes
`scripts` - GDScript for player, enemies and systems
`ui-` - User interface elements

---

## Next Steps

1. Integrate final sprites (player, enemies, attacks)
2. Create full animations (idle, walk, run, jump, attack)
3. Implement additional visual effects (particles, lighting)
4. Expand level design and add obstacles/challenges
5. Adjust physics, combat balance, and gameplay feel
6. Add ambient sounds and sound effects

## Development Plan

- **Week 1:** Initial structure and player movement
- **Week 2:** Combat system and player states
- **Week 3:** Polishing, UI and scene transitions
- **Week 4:** Refinement, documentation and planning future levels

> This plan ensures the prototype is playable and scalable even without the final assets.
